Adding New Pets
The application comes with sample pets (Whiskers the cat and Buddy the dog). You can modify the initial data in the PetFeedingTracker.jsx file:
javascriptconst [pets, setPets] = useState([
  { 
    id: 1, 
    name: 'Your Pet Name', 
    avatar: '🐱', // Change emoji
    schedule: [
      { time: '07:00', amount: '1 cup', completed: false },
      { time: '19:00', amount: '1 cup', completed: false }
    ]
  }
]);
Customizing Feeding Times
Modify the schedule array to match your pets' feeding routine:

time: 24-hour format (HH:MM)
amount: Feeding portion description
completed: Automatically managed by the app
